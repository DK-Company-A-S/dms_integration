# DMS Integration

## Development environment
Prerequisites:
- Java 17 JDK
- Maven
- VOCES certificate

## Using the tool
A guide to using the tool can be found [here](usage_guide).

## The Simple-as4-Client package
A custom version of the Simple-as4-client has been compiled and the jar is found at: `packages/io/github/skat/as4-client/2.2.0-local/as4-client-2.2.0-local.jar`.

This version of as4-client has been modified so that OCES3 certificates can be used.

This jar must be added as a maven dependency.
